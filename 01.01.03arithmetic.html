<h2 class="western">Chapter 1: Counting</h2>
<h3 class="western">Section 1: Counting and representation</h3>
<p>Abstract: Counting systems, Roman and based. Focus on base-10,
base-2, and base-16. Representation in Python.</p>
<p>Terms: Number, numeral, Roman, base, decimal, binary, hexadecimal,
add.</p>
<p>Symbols: |, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0b0, 0b1, 0x0, 0x1, ...,
0xa, 0xb, ..., 0xf</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How can we count?</p>
<p>Answer: Without a symbol system for counting, we at least have
language for counting, using words like &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;,
and so on. But a written symbol system has the advantage of aiding
memory and calculation when we want to add numbers.</p>
<p>A natural way to begin counting is, for each number, make a mark!
So for instance, we could use | as the symbol and count one, two, so
on, as |, ||, |||, ...</p>
<p>However, this gets tedious for large numbers, and is particularly
difficult to add numbers with.
</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How can we count more efficiently, hopefully so that
adding is easier?</p>
<p>Answer: Another natural first thought is to group numbers as you
count, so that you make a symbol like V for five, and X for ten, and
so on. Then to count would go |, ||, |||, ||||, V, V|, V||, V|||,
V||||, X, X|, ...</p>
<p>But adding is still a strain. What is XXX|||| + XXXXXXXV|||? Be
careful not to convert these to your own number system--that would be
cheating! And even if you can figure this out and think it's not so
bad, try multiplying them!</p>
<p>Clearly we need a better system.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: What's a more efficient way to count so that it's easier
to to add and multiply?</p>
<p>Answer: Here the answer might be surprising. It's the use of a
base system. In a base system, you only ever directly represent a
certain small number of numbers. In our base system, which is
&quot;decimal&quot; or &quot;base-10&quot;, we represent ten numbers
with the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. To represent
larger numbers, we create a new digit place to the left, which counts
<i>groupings</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
Hence 10 has a 1 in the tens-place representing a group of ten. 11 is
just one more than this. 23 represents two groups of ten (twenty in
total of course) and another 3 units. In 123 the 1 in the
hundreds-place represents a group of ten units to the right--i.e. ten
tens, or one-hundred in total. The 2 and 3 are in the tens and units
places respectively and represent in the familiar way. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">To make sure that
the idea here is clear, let us imagine using a base system that is
not decimal. Let's instead use &quot;binary&quot; or &quot;base-2&quot;
numbers, where the symbol set is 0 and 1--however, because this is
ambiguous we will represent binary numbers with the prefix &quot;0b&quot;.
Hence the symbol set is 0b0 and 0b1. These count zero and one. To
represent two we use 0b10 and three is 0b11.
</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Show what it looks like to count to ten in binary.</p>
<p>Answer: 0b1, 0b10, 0b11, 0b100, 0b101, 0b110, 0b111, 0b1000,
0b1001, 0b1010.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Use Python to represent binary numbers. First use
<font face="FreeMono, monospace">bin(10)</font> to convert the
decimal 10 to a binary representation. What kind of an object does it
return, a number or a string? If you're not familiar with Python
numbers and strings, make sure you go through the programming
prerequisites.
</p>
<p>Answer: Python should return the string '0b1010'.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Use <font face="FreeMono, monospace">int('0b1010101', 2)</font>
to see what this represents in decimal. Of course the 2 indicates
that '0b1010101' should be read in binary.</p>
<p>Answer: 85</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Use Python to explore hexadecimal representation, which
is base-16. In typical hexadecimal representation, we use symbols 0,
1, 2, ..., 9, a, b, c, d, e, f where a represents 10 and so on. But
again the symbols invite too much ambiguity so we use the prefix 0x0
for zero, and so on until 0xf represents 15. Of course 0x10
represents 16. Use <font face="FreeMono, monospace">hex(10)</font> to
represent ten and <font face="FreeMono, monospace">hex(100)</font> to
represent 100. Also use <font face="FreeMono, monospace">int('abcd')</font>
to see what this is in decimal.
</p>
<p>Answer: In order, Python should show `'0xa'`, `'0x64'`, and
`43981`.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Why is base representation better?</p>
<p>Answer: Base representation does a good job of counting large
numbers with relative few symbols. As an exercise you can figure out
how many digits are needed in binary numbers to represent the number
one-million. You may be surprised at how few digits are needed. Base
representation also has the nice feature that, unlike the Roman
system where you group all quantities of a certain size, like five or
ten, in a base system you keep grouping <i>groups</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
300 represents three groups of ten, where each one of those ten is
itself a group of ten. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">But the real
promise of base representation was that it would help us compute
better. That in the next page.</p>
