<h1>Logic 
</h1>
<p>This topic presents the material that one finds in a
first-semester course in Symbolic Logic, with particular focus on
applications in mathematical proofs, and extended chapters on
relevant themes.  Here we begin a more rigorous study, unlike
Arithmetic which was at times gap-y in order to avoid too much
theory.  
</p>
<p>We define a propositional language and semantics for the language,
define concepts and relationships of sentences.  We then see the use
of Propositional Logic in understanding the working parts of some
mathematical arguments.  After that we introduce a first-order
language and its semantics, which decomposes expressions into finer
components.  Again we define concepts and analyze the working parts
of other mathematical arguments.  Finally we introduce a few other
themes like proof by induction and second-order logic.  
</p>
<p>Topics for further study like Modal Logic, Proof Theory, Model
Theory, and so on, are reserved for their own later topics.
