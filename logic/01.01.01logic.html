of opposition, followed by an even briefer tour of over 2,000 years
of the history of Logic, ending in a suggestion about what we will
study in this topic.</p>

<p>Question: What is the right way to reason? 
</p>
<p>Answer: This is a philosophical question, and we will not attempt
to answer it in its totality. But having some scruples about how a
good argument works is still a good idea.  It's hard to know where to
start.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: What did old, dead, mostly white men say about this?</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese all have philosophers in
their intellectual traditions who studied Logic. For much of the
early history of the topic, people focused on which arguments were
good, and what made them good. Appeals to authority, verifiability,
coherence in a network of beliefs, all seemed to make a showing in
one way or another. Aristotle had a particularly interesting analysis
of logic, as it was comprehensive, focused, organized, and the most
startling feature was that--almost in anticipation of modern studies
in Logic thousands of years later--it always had a eye toward
describing the features of the logical system itself, rather than
only describing practical use of the logical system in individual
arguments. This is so-called &quot;meta-theory&quot;, or the theory
of the theory, which is the primary subject of modern Mathematical
Logic.</p>
<p>I would love to give a wider view of history and philosophical
authorities, but for the sake of staying on-target, Aristotle really
the best pick if we're going to pick just one.  He's an old, dead,
white man, but he was really on to something.</p>
<p>Many different philosophers and traditions focused on describing
the features that make a good argument. Appeal to authority,
verifiability, coherence in a network of beliefs, all made some kind
of appearance in some philosophers' meditations on Logic. However, in
Aristotle's work the single central notion was deduction: Moving from
one set of sentences to a new sentence justified by those before it.
The canonical example is 
</p>
<p>(1) All men are mortal.</p>
<p>(2) Socrates is a man.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</p>
<p>The first two sentences are premises.  They supply justification
for the third sentence, called the conclusion.  Forgive the
gendering, times were different then, back when a men were men except
sometimes when they were part horse.  
</p>
<p>In Aristotle's vocabulary this is called a <i>syllogism</i><span style="font-style: normal">,
what today we call a </span><i>deduction</i><span style="font-style: normal">.
 He distinguished deduction from another &quot;good&quot; form of
argument, </span><i>induction</i><span style="font-style: normal">. 
Aristotle characterizes induction as &quot;argument from the
particular to the universal&quot;, for example, by observing fish and
their ability to swim, therefore concluding that all fish swim. 
Deduction is distinguished for Aristotle as argument from the
universal (&quot;All men are mortal&quot;) to the particular
(&quot;Socrates is mortal&quot;).  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">Today we would characterize
induction by its (greater? more direct or narrow?) use of empirical
evidence and probabilistic reasoning; deduction would be
characterized as more mathematical, involving reasoning that is
either independent of evidence.  We would characterize the inference
from </span><i>x+1 = 2</i><span style="font-style: normal"> to </span><i>x=1</i><span style="font-style: normal">
as deductive; the inference from &quot;every fish I've observed can
swim&quot; to &quot;fish swim&quot; is inductive.  I'm tip-toeing
over some philosophical ground with these parentheses that maybe I
should run a little rougher over.  Hopefully the distinction between
induction and deduction is clear, at least in their modern uses.  Of
course, we will be studying deduction for now.  Once we understand
Probability better, we'll make some slow and hard-fought gains in
understanding induction--in my opinion induction is both extremely
difficult to analyze in a useful way, and yet also an extremely
important feature of reason.  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">Much of Aristotle's deductions
studied the predication of objects.  So much fancy-talk here, but
objects are just the things we talk about.  In sentence (2) above, we
predicated of Socrates that he is a man.  Socrates was the object,
&quot;is a man&quot; was the predicate.  Predicates are like
properties, and objects have properties.  However, some predicates
are not exactly the kinds of things we would regard as a property,
like &quot;is at home&quot;--maybe we would call this an &quot;accidental
property&quot; rather than an &quot;intrinsic property&quot;.  In the
sentence &quot;the water molecule has an oxygen atom&quot; there are
two objects, the water molecule and the oxygen atom.  The predicate
&quot;has a/an&quot; connects these two things.  We usually wouldn't
think of &quot;has a/an&quot; is a property, but here we use it as a
predicate, or a relation--we regard properties and relations as very
similar sorts of things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">Statements involving predicts can
be of a particular, like &quot;Socrates is a man&quot;, but they can
also be of universals, like &quot;all fish swim&quot; or &quot;all
men are mortal&quot;.  These are so-called &quot;all&quot; sentences.
 The sentence &quot;someone ate the cookies&quot; is taken to be
equivalent to &quot;at least one person ate the cookies&quot;--the
speaker could intend to mean that exactly one person ate the cookies,
but could also mean that two or three or a hundred people did, so we
will assume the latter.  In any case, this &quot;some&quot; sentence
is about a particular (or particulars), even though no specific
object is mentioned.  There are also &quot;no&quot; sentences, &quot;not
every&quot;, and &quot;some not&quot;.  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;all&quot;: All men are
mortal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;some&quot;: Someone ate the
cookies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;not all&quot;: Not all cats
are orange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;not some&quot;: Not one
fish can read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;all not&quot;: All men are
not fish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;some not&quot;:  Some men
are not women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">So much variety.  Can we find
unity?  Notice that some of these are actually a bit superfluous. 
&quot;All men are mortal&quot; is the same as saying &quot;Not one
man is immortal.&quot;  Aristotle delivered the &quot;square of
opposition&quot; wherein sentence forms that are diagonal from each
other are contrary to each other.  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">__Example__</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">Here's an example of how this
analysis helps us.  Suppose two people are in a political argument
and one says &quot;Every law should be obeyed.&quot;  The other
responds, &quot;Just yesterday you went 5 miles-an-hour over the
speed limit.&quot;  The former says &quot;Yeah, that's different.&quot;
 This effectively has the form &quot;All A's are B&quot; as this is
the form of &quot;All laws are obligatory&quot; (rephrasing to make A
and B obvious).  To which the other person asserts &quot;</span><i>x</i><span style="font-style: normal">
is A but not B&quot;, which is &quot;the speed limit law is a law
that is not obligatory&quot;.  The translation into the official form
is not perfect, but presumably the interlocutors would both agree
with this sentence and that it's the point behind saying &quot;you
went 5 miles-an-hour over&quot;.  The second person giving
justification for the sentence &quot;something is A but not B&quot;
which is in contradiction to the first sentence, &quot;all A is B&quot;.
 </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">Now the first person is, with
&quot;that's different&quot;, either trying to weasel out of full
commitment to their first premise, or said more politely, trying to
qualify precisely which laws she has in mind.  But if that's so, she
needs to do a better job of articulating exactly which laws she has
in mind, before she can suppose that she has adequately made her
point and reasonably expect others to comply with the principle.  </span>
</p>

<p>Question: What is the point here?  Where is this going?</p>
<p>Answer: This has been a quick--so quick as to be almost
non-existent--description of ancient studies in Logic.  I just want
to give a taste so that the reader can contrast and observe how
modern Logic is different.  This can help you to see what it is that
we're trying to do in modern Logic.  Modern Logic is symbolic and
abstract in the way that Math is.  
</p>
<p>Pre-symbolic analysis was largely informal and philosophical in
nature.  Aristotle elevated the level of formalism and organization
of the topics, but not to the level of a full-blown mathematical
study.  After Aristotle, there were no deep sea changes in what
people thought about Logic.  The medieval Europeans and Islamic
scholars did further some investigations, particularly in the topic
of &quot;modal logic&quot;.  Modal logic was the study of necessary
and accidental properties, largely motivated by religious and
philosophical questions.  However, about 2,000 years after
Aristotle's writings, philosopher Immanuel Kant expressed a sentiment
that was at least roughly shared by a large number of his
contemporaries when he said that little if anything in the field of
Logic has been improved since Aristotle.</p>
<p>However, Kant was writing pretty close to the cusp of a future
movement.  Mechanization of labor had been world-changing to
Europe--especially in the wake of bubonic plague, wiping out much of
the labor force and creating the need for a small number of people to
perform a large amount of labor.  In the use of better scientific
technology to build ships and then navigate them, Europe brutally
plundered the world over and profited wildly at the time.  This was
largely seen by Europeans at the time as an unqualified good.  Maps
were physical devices that encoded information, and astrolabes did
something like calculation for navigators.  The philosopher and
mathematician Leibniz, co-inventor of Calculus, grew up in this
scientific and technical Europe, and wondered whether machines could
not just do physical labor but also mental labor.  He imagined a
thinking machine that could solve Math problems with the turning of
gears, or possibly other physical mechanisms.  He was anticipating
the computer, and even was responsible for the construction of some
non-digital computers that could perform simple arithmetic.  These
would eventually evolved into slide rules.  Slide rules, if you're
not familiar with them, are super awesome non-digital calculators
that were common place in American high schools in the 1950s. You
should go buy and play with one right damned now, they are
fascinating.</p>
<p>Not long after Leibniz came George Boole, also a mathematician and
philosopher, interested in a mathematical study of Logic and
Probability.  He came to realize that there is almost an arithmetic
of truth--a tantalizing way of stating something that actually is a
little more mundane than you might imagine.  If you know that
sentences A and B are true but C is false, then the sentence &quot;A
and B or C&quot; can be &quot;calculated&quot; from knowing the
truths of the component sentences, kind of like how you can calculate
<i>x+yz</i><span style="font-style: normal"> from knowing the numeric
values of </span><i>x, y, </i><span style="font-style: normal">and </span><i>z.</i><span style="font-style: normal">
 When, decades later, Frege formalized this fully in a calculus of
sentences, and further decomposed the sentences into predicates and
objects, the study of Logic had reached a very serious milestone.  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">Up to this point the
mathematicians had mostly ignored the formal study of Logic,
regarding it I think as a kind of interesting, vaguely mathematical,
but not truly mathematical study.  After Frege, the mathematicians
started piling on in a serious way, beginning with Russell, crossing
paths with Turing and the development of modern computers, and
flourishing into the fairly cutting-edge and large field that it is
today.  The mathematical study of logic today asks a lot of questions
about the properties of logical systems, what kinds of sentences can
be proved in them, and so on.  In most of these conversations, the
distinction between syntax and semantics is crucial.  The syntax is
the dead, meaningless symbols used in a language, and it also
describes the rules for composing symbols together to form
&quot;well-formed expressions&quot; and &quot;sentences&quot;.  The
semantics is the &quot;meaning&quot; (in some sense) of those dead,
material, finite symbols--the semantics is robust, live, mysterious,
and floating in the ether.  Ok, that's a little dramatic, but the
point is that we do our best to capture the semantics in a syntactic
system, and the study of Logic is often concerned with just how well
we do that.  </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">So there you have it, a lightning
history and a flurry of name-dropping.  Now we will start Symbolic
Logic.</span></p>
