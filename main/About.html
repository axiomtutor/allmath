<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is an attempt to explain all of modern Mathematics, targeted
at an intellectually mature reader. Of course discussing all of
modern Mathematics is impossible, but by approximating infinity maybe
we will get somewhere.  By "intellectual maturity" I mean the ability
and willingness to think abstractly, to be in a state of uncertainty
and work through it, and the self-discipline to do research.</p>
<p>Throughout I try to motivate investigations with natural
questions, sometimes with natural physical, statistical, or other
interpretations. Unlike in most Math texts where the questions and
exercises can be skipped and still you will find a logical
development in the rest of the text--in this website, the
mathematical content is entirely in the answers to questions and
exercises, so that no question can be skipped without missing the
logical flow of ideas. When you read a question I intend for the
reader to think for at most a few minutes, make some sincere attempt
at an answer, whether they can or cannot answer the question, then
check my answer. Exercises require less originality than that but
often lead to insights that cannot be skipped either. Definitions,
theorems, and more are contained in answers to questions.
</p>
<p>The emphasis here is on explanation and understanding, and the
reader is encouraged to answer the questions and give explanations,
if only to oneself. I also use software as a calculator and
illustrator, especially the Python programming language and Geogebra
software, both of which are free. If you're not familiar with the
basics of programming in Python I encourage starting with that
section--although I don't mean to teach Python programming, much of
this website will be hard to follow without reproducing the Python
examples. Every section, from Arithmetic and thereafter, assumes that
you have seen the programming prerequisites linked above. It is a
very fast and basic introduction, so if you're comfortable with
Python you can skip it.</p>
<p>The structure is to start at the very beginning with Arithmetic
and simple representation in base-10. The section on Arithmetic
progresses through standard operations and their closures until we
reach complex numbers and basic arithmetic with them. We progress to
modular arithmetic and advanced counting, stopping shy of a full
course on Number Theory and Combinatorics. From there we progress
through Logic, Algebra, Geometry, and Discrete Math. At this point,
the particular sequence of subjects becomes less important and a
choose-you-own-adventure is possible. At the start of each topic I
indicate the prerequisites.
