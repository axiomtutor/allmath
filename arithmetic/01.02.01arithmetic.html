<p>Question: How can we add numbers?</p>
<p>Answer: By organizing two numbers into groups of ones, tens, and
so on, when we sum the digits we are so-to-speak summing similar
terms. Summing groups of ones results in a count of simple units.
Summing groups of tens results in a count of tens, etc. Thus to sum
987+65 we can sum just the units, 7+5, and get 12. We can sum the
tens, 8+6 = 14. Since we can split off a group of 10 from the units,
we can say that the sum has 9 groups of 100, 13 groups of 10, and 2
units. We can again split off a group of 10 tens, now call this 10
groups of 100, 3 tens, 2 units. Now split off again, and the result
is 1 thousands, 0 hundreds, 3 tens, 2 units, or 1032. Organizing this
process in a table makes it more readable and efficient.</p>

<p>Exercise: Find 995+551.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>__Example__</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Find 4 + 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999.</p>
<p>Answer: You could do this by brute force, but it's intended as an
exercise in understanding base representation. If you are really
understanding everything here, you might see that you can split up
the 4 and distribute it to every other summand, which easily
calculates. Follow the derivation below.</p>
<p>4 + 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 =
</p>
<p>(1+1+1+1) + 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 =
</p>
<p>(1+9) + (1+99) + (1+999) + (1+9999) =
</p>
<p>10 + 100 + 1000 + 10000 =
</p>
<p>11110</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How do you add binary numbers?</p>
<p>Answer: First let's establish some vocabulary.
</p>
<p>Definition: The result of adding numbers we call the <b>sum</b>,
and each component we call a <b>summand</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.
Thus in 987+65 the sum is 1032 while 987 is a summand and so is 65.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal">Now to add binary numbers we do the
same as with decimal numbers, except that rather than being able to
compute any summands from 0 to 9, now we only need to be able to
compute any summands 0b0 and 0b1.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal">__Example__</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Find 0b1001+0b1011</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>__Example__</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Find 0b100 + 0b1 + 0b11 + 0b111 + 0b1111.</p>
<p>Answer: Just as in the analogous exercise in decimal, here we can
split the first number and distribute it to the others.</p>
<p>0b100 + 0b1 + 0b11 + 0b111 + 0b1111 =
</p>
<p>(0b1+0b1+0b1+0b1) + 0b1 + 0b11 + 0b111 + 0b1111 =
</p>
<p>(0b1+0b1) + (0b1+0b11) + (0b1+0b111) + (0b1+0b1111) =
</p>
<p>0b10 + 0b100 + 0b1000 + 0b10000 =
</p>
<p>0b11110</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: I have used what is called the commutative property of
addition.</p>
<p>Definition: Addition is said to be <b>commutative</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">because
4+5 is the same sum as 5+4 and likewise for any other numbers one
could pick. Otherwise said, if </span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x+y</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">is
any sum of numbers, then </span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x+y
= y+x</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
How could we justify the claim that addition is commutative?</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
Answer: I'll tend to justify things, at this level, by representing
summands as dots on the left and right. In this view 4+5 is
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
__Example__</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
and 5+4 is
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
__Example__</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
Since swapping the summands is simply transposing the dots, but the
total quantity remains the same under a transpose, then we have
justified the commutative law. This is not a rigorous argument, one
cannot really exist at this level--usually the commutativity of
addition is assumed rather than proved. This is not true in
Foundations where addition is constructed by simpler primitive
principles, but we're not there yet.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: At what point in the above work have I used the
commutativity of addition?</p>
<p>Answer: When arguing that (1+1+1+1) + 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 = (1+9)
+ (1+99) + (1+999) + (1+9999). If I did this step-by-step we'd have
the intermediate use of commutativity (1+1+1+1) + 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999
= 1+1+1+9+1+99+999+9999 and then keep doing likewise until all the 1s
are in place.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: The above argument also makes use of another property of
addition, called associativity.</p>
<p>Definition: We say that addition is <b>associative</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">because
</span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">.
</span></span></span>
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
Where was associativity used and how could we justify its truth?</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
Answer: Of course the re-arranging of parentheses was also used, in
addition to commutativity, in arguing that (1+1+1+1) + 9 + 99 + 999 +
9999 = (1+9) + (1+99) + (1+999) + (1+9999). To identify the exact
point where it was used we would have to draw out all the implied
intermediate steps, which is not terribly important right now.</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
Associativity is justified again by thinking of collections of dots.
If we have three collections, it doesn't matter which two we combine
first--the total is unaffected.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Note: Commutativity and associativity may seem so trivial as to be
not worth discussing. I bring them up here, in a context where things
are easy. We will eventually see examples were commutativity fails
and so does associativity--in fact, both will fail very soon, in the
context of subtraction. It will be more insightful to see them fail
in more advanced contexts like matrices.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: What number, when added to 5, results in 12?</p>
<p>Answer: 7</p>
<p>This exercise can be seen in two useful ways. For one thing, it is
the same as the solution of the equation <i>x+5 = 12</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
We won't focus on this perspective much until discussing Algebra, but
it's easy enough to understand now. From another perspective, it is
the same as 12 minus 5, so that in a sense this defines the
subtraction operation. Of course the interpretation of 12-5 is the
amount that remains when 5 is taken away from 12, but it will be
helpful to think of many inverse operations as the answer to a
certain kind of question, like we have here. So in general we define </span></span>

<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Definition:

<hr/>

<p>Question: What is 123-45?</p>
<p>Answer: We can again make a table algorithm for computing the
difference.
</p>
<p>Definition: An <b>algorithm </b><span style="font-weight: normal">is
any fully specified sequence of steps that take some well-defined
input and return a well-defined output.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">But to come up with the
algorithm, let's first think this out: We want to find the number,
call it </span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">,
such that </span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x+45=123</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">.
We could try to guess 100, but that's too big. </span></span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Note:
These considerations illustrate that, what we want is the largest
value of </span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">that's
not too large. Later on what we could call this is the infimum, or
the &quot;greatest lower-bound&quot;. For now I just want to drop in
that perspective to warm you up to it--but we won't actually use it
until much later. Why not the supremum, the smallest value not too
small? In this case it amounts to the same thing, but the infimum
perspective is more useful to &quot;quickly&quot; reach the answer. I
won't explain why now, as this note is already long and I've
introduced the concepts that I wanted to--we'll learn more about
these ideas when discussing algorithms more specifically.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">But
clearly if we go down by an order, down to 10, then 10 is too small
for </span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">.
60 is an easy guess because 60+45 = 105. From there we can guess 20
extra, but of course this is too much: 20+60+45 = 125. So we ratchet
down to 10+60+45 = 115, and of course give it another 5 and then
another 3. In total</span></span></span></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
3+5+10+60+45 = 123
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
or more to the point</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
78+45 = 123</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
and therefore 123-45 = 78.
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
This algorithm is hard to formalize, but it's possible. However, we
can tweak it to get a simpler table algorithm. The main problem is
what to do when the digit below is larger than the digit above, like
the 3 and the 9 in the difference 123-98.</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
__Example__</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
To correct this we can borrow everywhere that's necessary first.
Hence in the table we represent this as
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
__Example__</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
Next we compute only differences where one digit is at most 19 and
the other is at most 9--as long as you have these differences
memorized, you can now compute the digit-wise difference.</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
__Example__</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Why does this algorithm work? Can we give a proof of its
correctness?</p>
<p>Answer: <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
proof is quite easy, which is to be expected given that the operation
is quite basic. First, borrowing does not change the quantity being
represented, it only changes the representation. Therefore nothing is
lost in this step. Finally, since every digit-wise difference
represents subtracting commensurable objects (e.g. 11 hundreds minus
9 hundreds makes sense and gives a count of how many hundreds remain
after subtraction) this validly divides the problem into parts,
performs the legitimate operation on the parts, and reassembles them
at the end.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">We could also
justify the algorithm, once we understand multiplication and
negatives adequately, by the principle that 123 - 98 = 110 + 13 - (90
+ 8) = (110-90) + (13-8) = (11-9)*10 + 5 = 2*10 + 5 = 25.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Devise a subtraction algorithm for binary numbers and
use it to find 0b10101 - 0b1010.</p>
<p>Answer:
</p>
<p>__Example__</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Why do we have no distinction between the right- and
left-summand--both are simply called a &quot;summand&quot;--whereas
for subtraction we distinguish the minuend and subtrahend?</p>
<p>Answer: The commutativity of addition implies that since <i>x+y =
y+x</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">then
the left-hand expression has no particular significance in addition.
In subtraction, although 5-4 = 1, on the other hand 4-5 makes no
sense with the interpretations we've been using so far. There is no
natural number which, when added to 5, produces 4. This illustrates
that subtraction is not commutative.</span></span></p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Is subtraction associative?</p>
<p>Answer: A simple example like 3-2-1 will demonstrate that the
answer is no. If we parenthesize it as 3-(2-1) = 3-1 = 2 we get a
different answer from the other way of parenthesizing, (3-2)-1 = 1-1
= 0.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Since subtraction expresses like 3-2-1 are ambiguous,
how can we deal with the ambiguity?</p>
<p>Answer: One way is to simply parenthesize everything as above in
order to explicitly rule out ambiguity.
</p>
<p>Another way is establish a set of assumptions, like 3-2-1 is
assumed to always mean 3-(2-1). This approach is common in Computer
Science. To assume that 3-2-1 means 3-(2-1) is to say that we assume
subtraction is <b>right-associative</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.
If we assume that 3-2-1 means (3-2)-1 then we are saying that we
assume subtraction is </span><b>left-associative</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.
We will use these concepts later.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal">Another way that I personally like a
whole lot more, which also makes an appearance in Computer Science,
is to use Polish notation, also called prefix notation. We could
write - 3 1 to mean three minus 1. Then we would say - 3 1 = 2. In
that case - - 3 2 1 would have to compute to - 1 1. There's just no
other meaningful interpretation of - - 3 2 1. To get the other
version, we would write - 3 - 2 1 which would have to evaluate to - 3
1. This avoids the need for assumptions and the need for writing a
whole lot of confusing parentheses when these expressions get long.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">Polish notation also has the
advantage that it gets you used to writing the function symbol at the
front, which is exactly the same thing that you do for sin(</span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">)
or </span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">f</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">(</span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">).
The function is written in the front and the inputs to the function
are written afterwards. Most of common Math is written in prefix,
function notation with the exceptions of the basic operations. </span></span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">However,
Polish notation comes with two significant disadvantages. For one
thing, which is probably most readers' immediate response, it looks
weird. You're not used to it. And it doesn't show up in most other
Math contexts. Normally if there were enough advantage, I wouldn't
heed that too much--you can learn to translate between the different
notation systems--but Polish notation has another flaw. It's not
graphical. In our usual notation system, we use graphical features
like concatenation to represent multiplication: </span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">xy</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">means
</span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">x </span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">times
</span></span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal">y</span></i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">.
We also use super-scripts for exponents and vertically stacked text
separated by a bar for division. These really help readability for
complex expressions and so I won't spend the energy trying to write
these notes in Polish notation.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
That said, I'll use left-associativity to solve the ambiguity
problem. Thus 5 - 4 - 1 = 0. Still that won't stop me from giving at
least one exercise in the use of Polish notation.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Evaluate + - + 5 4 3 2 and evaluate + 5 - 4 + 3 5.</p>
<p>Answer: 8 and 9.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Determine how Python resolves ambiguity by entering
5-4-1. If Python uses left-associativity what should it tell you? If
it uses right-associativity, what should it tell you?</p>
<p>Answer: Python uses left-associativity, which is why I use it, and
which is why it evaluates 5-4-1 as 0. If it used right-associativity
it would answer 2.</p>
