<p>Abstract: Rationals are the closure under division and represent
the ability to segment a quantity into any number of pieces of equal
size--they also represent ratios.</p>
<p>Terms: Rational, reciprocal, decimal expansion</p>
<p>Symbols: ℚ, ∊, .</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: What do we get if we next close our number system under
division as we did with subtraction?</p>
<p>Answer: We form the set ℚ = {<i>z : z = x/y</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">where
</span></span><i>x,y</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">are
integers and </span></span><i>y</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
not 0}. In fact, let's introduce another piece of notation for sets,
so that we can economize expressions a little more. We use the symbol
∊ to mean &quot;in&quot; so that </span></span><i>x∊A</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">claims
that element </span></span><i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
in set </span></span><i>A</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
This let's us say ℚ = {</span></span><i>z : z = x/y, </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">for</span></span>
<i>x,y</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> ∊ ℤ </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
</span></span><i>y ≠ 0</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">}.
Of course that's the abstract answer. Physically this corresponds to
endlessly breaking quantities into pieces even below the level of the
single unit. For instance 2/3 is physically interpreted as breaking a
unit into three equal pieces and keeping two. We call these numbers
</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>rational</b></span></span><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">numbers
because they correspond to the concept of a ratio of two numbers. We
call the set ℚ for &quot;quotient&quot; since in a sense, it is the
set of all quotients of integers.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Note: It is a
little ironic that rationals come after the integers in the standard
construction of number sets, and yet rationals were &quot;accepted&quot;
as numbers earlier than the integers were. The Greeks were relatively
satisfied with the idea of dividing a quantity, if not infinitely,
then at least very much. However, they rejected any notion of a
negative since these numbers cannot do any counting--so they thought
anyway. 
</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: So we have rationals now. How do we add, multiply, and
so on?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a pretty tough one to answer <i>a priori</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
Most readers will undoubtedly know the routine but perhaps not the
justifications, even if they have a fairly good Math background. To
sum any (</span></span><i>p/q) + (r/s)</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
too difficult to answer directly. For instance what is (1/2) + (1/3)?
Let's focus first on an easier question.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">What's (1/3) +
(1/3)? Of course in each case we have a quantity obtained by dividing
a unit into three equal pieces and keeping one of them. If we sum
them, we now have two of them. So (1/3) + (1/3) = 2/3. In fact, from
this perspective, it might be helpful to think of the bottom number
not as dividing but as measuring in a certain standard length. For
instance we could regard 1 as meaning 1 meter, and then 1/3 just
means that the unit of measurement is thirds-of-a-meter and there's
one of them. From this perspective, summing (1/2) + (1/3) is trying
to sum lengths measured in different units of measurement. To figure
out the sum we need to convert units, but we need to find a &quot;bridge&quot;
unit that we can convert both of them into. 
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">With a bit of
thought you might realize that by breaking halves into three equal
pieces, you get six equally sized pieces; and by breaking thirds into
two equally sized pieces you get six equally sized pieces. So 1/2 can
be converted into 3/6 and 1/3 can be converted into 2/6, so that
sixths is our bridge-unit. From here we can sum (1/2) + (1/3) = (3/6)
+ (2/6) = 5/6.</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The standard high
school algorithm is to get a &quot;common denominator&quot;. Often
this means just multiplying the two denominators, like 2*3 = 6 as in
the previous example. However, in some cases it is possible to find a
different bridge unit. Take for instance (7/4) + (11/6). We could
choose 24 as the bridge unit (or really 24ths, but you know what I
mean) but 12 is possible too and easier to use. (7/4) + (11/6) =
(21/12) + (22/12) = 43/12.</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">__Example__</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How do we find the smallest possible bridge unit?</p>
<p>Answer: It's the lcm of the two denominators! Of course this makes
sense, we need to give each denominator <i>just</i> enough extra
factors until they contain the same factors and so are the same
number--but we don't want to give any more factors than we have to.
This is just what the lcm does.</p>
<p>For instance, lcm(2,3) = 6 and lcm(4,6) = 12. The lcm in a sense
gives 2 a factor of 3 and gives 3 a factor of 2, in order to convert
both into 6. The work that we put into understanding primes and
factorization is coming in handy.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How do we subtract rationals?</p>
<p>Answer: Of course the same method applies, in which we get a
&quot;common denominator&quot; and compute the difference of the
numerators.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How do we multiply rationals?</p>
<p>Answer: Again this is hard to approach directly. Choosing an
easier intermediate question, what if the right factor is an integer?
We use repeated addition or some similar trick as we studied in the
previous section--and we require multiplication to be commutative so
that this works also if there's an integer in the left factor. This
then means that <i>p/q * r = pr/q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
</span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">If
we are to next try to understand </span></span><i>(p/q) * (r/s)</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">then
it would be helpful to think of this as actually saying </span></span><i>((p/q)*r)/s</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
No, I'm not using associativity here, as that's not valid for
division--instead, I'm interpreting &quot;* </span></span><i>(r/s)&quot;</i>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">as
&quot;multiply by </span></span><i>r</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
then divide by </span></span><i>s</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;.
In a sense I'm packing a special parenthesis-shifting law into the
very definition of multiplying rational numbers. Notice that we saw
in the previous chapter that natural numbers have this property
assuming that </span></span><i>q|p</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
</span></span><i>s|r</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">,
so in a sense we're just enforcing that rationals also have this
property even when divisibility does not hold. </span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">But
to seal the deal we need to say how one divides a rational by an
integer. What should </span></span><i>(p/q) / z </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">be?
Of course if we break the units into </span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">equal
pieces and then break each of those into </span></span><i>z</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">equal
pieces, then we have </span></span><i>qz</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">equal
pieces. Thus </span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><i>(p/q)
/ z</i></span><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">should
be the same as </span></span><i>p / (qz).</i></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">At
this point we're justified in saying that </span></span><i>(p/q) *
(r/s) = (pr) / (qs)</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
To reiterate, the logic is that we construe this as first
multiplication by </span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><i>r</i></span><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">putting
it in the numerator, then division by </span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><i>s</i></span><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">putting
it in the denominator. So for instance (1/2) (3/4) = 3/8.</span></span></p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Justify why, if <i>p</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
</span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">are
integers with any common factor, call it </span></span><i>m</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">,
then </span></span><i>p/q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
the same as the rational number with the </span></span><i>m</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">removed
from both </span></span><i>p</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
</span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
So for instance 2 and 10 have a common factor of 2, therefore 2/10 =
1/5.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Answer:
We can give a physical and an abstract answer. The abstract answer is
that, if </span></span><i>p, q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">share
factor </span></span><i>m</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">then
there exist integers </span></span><i>x, y</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">such
that </span></span><i>p = mx, q = my</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
therefore </span></span><i>p/q = (mx)/(my) = (m/m)(x/y) = 1(x/y) =
x/y</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
Of course the fact that </span></span><i>m/m = 1 </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
something we knew from natural number operations. </span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
physical answer is that </span></span><i>m</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">only
breaks up quantities in the denominator, and then puts just as many
back together in the numerator. Think of 2/4 which has a factor of 2
in both the numerator and denominator. This means that we broke a
unit in half and then in half again, and took two of the halves. We
could have just as well broken the unit in half and stopped. </span></span>

<p>Question: It's harder to compare rationals than it is to compare
integers. Which is bigger, 81/37 or 100/51? There are <i>ad hoc</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">tricks
that you can leverage to answer this. But let's make a general
procedure once and for all. If </span></span><i>p/q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
</span></span><i>r/s</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">are
rational numbers, give an algorithm that assumes only the ability to
compare integers, in order to determine which is larger. </span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Answer:
One way to do this is to assume </span></span><i>p/q &lt; r/s </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">in
order to investigate what is equivalent to this being true.
Intuitively we should be able to multiply both sides of this by any
number we want--as long as we pick the same number on both sides. I
mean, think of how it would work with integers. Since 20 &lt; 30 then
by doubling we get 40 &lt; 60, and we could even halve and get 10 &lt;
15. The numbers may grow farther apart or closer together but they
never switch sides. You can even think of this process as &quot;scaling
things up&quot; or scaling down. Of course this assumes that we
multiply or divide by a positive. If you experiment with a negative
then things don't work so well, so to keep things easy let's assume </span></span><i>s</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
positive. </span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Anyway,
with that principle established then </span></span><i>p/q &lt; r/s</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
equivalent to </span></span><i>s(p/q) &lt; sr/s</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">which
can simplify to </span></span><i>sp/q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">&lt;
r. Does this look like improvement? Well at least we have only one
fraction rather than two. If we do this again with </span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">this
time, again assuming </span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
positive, then we get the expression </span></span><i>ps &lt; rq</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">which
is equivalent to the one we started with after doing all appropriate
cancellation. This serves as our test, or a very short algorithm: </span></span><i>p/q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
less than </span></span><i>r/s</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">if
</span></span><i>ps</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
less than </span></span><i>qr</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
</span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">A
natural question is, what happens if one multiplies an inequation
like this by a negative? Experimentation will show you that it always
flips the inequation. Can we prove that it does? Suppose </span></span><i>p
&lt; q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">where
</span></span><i>p, q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">may
be integers or rationals. Then simply by subtraction on both sides by
</span></span><i>p</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
</span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">we
see that _</span></span><i>q &lt; _p</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
But this also has the upshot that this is the result of multiplying
by _1. Hence multiplying by _1 flips the inequation around.
Multiplying by any other negative quantity is the same as multiplying
by _1 and then the &quot;rest&quot; of the number so to speak, so
that this proof really covers all cases. We have shown, then, that
multiplying by any negative flips the inequation. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">As a closing note
before we move on to other questions, of course a test for less-than
is automatically a reverse test for greater-than. Testing whether 3/7
&gt; 4/9 is just a matter of testing whether 4/9 &lt; 3/7 so we
already have that covered. A test for equality can work exactly the
same way, although a possibly more efficient algorithm is simply to
reduce the fraction to its simplest expression--and it makes some
obvious sense to believe that every rational number has a reduction
to a least expression. We'll discuss that idea more in Number Theory
but for now it just makes good sense. 
</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How do we divide rationals?</p>
<p>Answer: As usual <i>(p/q) / (r/s)</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">means
finding the number which when multiplied by </span></span><i>r/s</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">results
in </span></span><i>p/q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
Of course an easy number that has this property is </span></span><i>(p/q)*(s/r)</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">because
when you multiply this by </span></span><i>r/s</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">you
get </span></span><i>(p/q)(s/r)(r/s) = (p/q)(rs/rs)</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Note: Now that
operations are getting big and ugly, I'm not going to be a stickler
about the left-associativity rule that I asserted earlier. To be more
precise, I'll use left-associativity on any operations that are
written in infix notation, but not if I use any other notation like
concatenation. I'll also take to writing fractions as `\frac{rs}{rs}`
and pay no attention to the left-associativity rule in such cases.</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">In any case what
we've just found is the so-called &quot;flip and multiply&quot; rule
for dividing rationals: `\frac{p // q}{r // s} = \frac{p}{q}\ast
\frac{s}{r}`.</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Because
the &quot;flip&quot; operation is useful for precisely this reason
then we give it the name of the </span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>reciprocal</b></span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">.
Thus the &quot;flip and multiply&quot; rule is inadequate, since most
students confused this at some time in their lives for thinking that
</span></span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">`\frac{p//q}{r//s}
= \frac{q}{p}\ast\frac{r}{s}`</span></span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">.
Instead the rule should be something like &quot;fix-product-flip&quot;
to indicate that the numerator remains fixed and only the denominator
is flipped.</span></span></span></p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: How do we exponentiate?</p>
<p>Answer: We skipped this question when the power was an integer
last time, and now we return to that case. Recall that we skipped
this because 1/2 had no meaning for us in that section but it does
now. By that sort of justification we can claim that 2^<sup>_1 </sup>=
1/2 and 2^<sup>_2</sup> should be half as big and therefore should be
1/4, and so on. This justifies claiming that, if <i>n</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
any natural number then 2^</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><sup><span style="font-style: normal">_n</span></sup></span><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">=

</span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">We
could justify it another way. Notice that we said </span></span><i>x^</i><sup><i>p</i></sup><i>x^</i><sup><i>q</i></sup>
<i>= x^</i><sup><i>p+q</i></sup> <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">because
we are aggregating the factors of </span></span><i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
By a similar logic, so long as the resulting power is a natural
number, we can justify saying </span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">`\frac{x^{\wedge
p}}{x^{\wedge q}} = x^{\wedge p-q}`</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">
because in the fraction we are canceling factors of </span></span><i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
But if we try to apply this for, say, </span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">`\frac{2^{\wedge
1}}{2^{\wedge 2}} = \frac{1}{2} = 2^{\wedge 1-2} = 2^{\wedge \_1}`</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">
then we get the same result as we did from the previous logic, making
this sound like a consistently good answer. </span></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
but immediately the question becomes harder when we try to figure out
the exponential where the power is a rational as well. What should

</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">be?
One indication can again come from our exponential laws, since if we
raise a power to a power, i.e. find `(2</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">^</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">{</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">\wedge

we should be able to multiply the powers and get 2^</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><sup><span style="font-style: normal">1</span></sup></span><span style="font-variant: normal">

<p>Exercise: Find `8^{\wedge 2/3}` and `2^{\wedge 1/2}`.</p>
<p>Answer: The former is easiest to compute by first finding the
cube-root, which is 2, then squaring which is 4. Of course the
official rule about this is to do things in reverse order, but it's
easy enough to show that the order doesn't matter, you'll get the
same answer either way.</p>
<p>The latter does not exist in our number system.

<p>Question: Can we prove that sqrt(2) is not a rational?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a very famous proof. We do this by contradiction,
which means that we assume sqrt(2) is rational and then prove that a
contradiction follows; therefore the assumption must have been false.</p>
<p>If sqrt(2) is rational then there must be integers <i>p, q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">such
that they share no common factor and </span></span><i>p/q = sqrt(2)</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
In that case 2 = </span></span><i>p^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><i>/q^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
from that we can infer that </span></span><i>2q^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup>
<i>= p^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><i>. </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">This
shows that </span></span><i>p^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">has
a factor of 2 and must be even. But that factor of 2 must have come
from </span></span><i>p</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
therefore </span></span><i>p^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">must
have two factors of 2. Well in that case </span></span><i>2q^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">must
also have two factors of 2. One of them is exhibited clearly but the
other one must come from </span></span><i>q^</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
But in that case </span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">has
a factor of 2! But we started off by asserting that </span></span><i>p</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
</span></span><i>q</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">had
no common factors and now they share 2! ⚡</span></span></p>

symbol is used to denote that we have arrived at a contradiction, and
is used to indicate the end of a proof by contradiction.</p>

<p>Exercise: Prove that cbrt(2) and sqrt(3) are not rational.</p>
<p>Answer: The same proof applies but either taking a third power
(former) or taking a second power and showing they share a factor of
3 (latter).</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Since sqrt(2) is not rational, what do we say about it?</p>
<p>Answer: For this section we say that it is not a rational number,
but we can approximate it with rational numbers. That is to say, we
can use 1 as a first approximation since 1^<sup>2</sup> = 1 is too
small. As a next approximation we could try 3/2 but its square, 9/4,
is larger than 2 and therefore over-shoots the goal. We could test
4/3 and find that this is too small but only by a little. If we
continue the process of guessing we can find numbers which square to
something closer and closer to 2, although the proof above
demonstrates that we will never find it perfectly. 
</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: We have been describing all rational numbers as
quotients, but it also makes some sense to find points in-between
integers by writing an expression like 2.3 to mean a number that is
between 2 and 3 and closer to 2 than 3. How much closer? If you broke
up the distance from 2 to 3 into ten equal pieces, we could label
them 2.1, 2.2, ..., 2.9. So 2.3 is the number that is 3 tenths of the
way from 2 to 3. 
</p>
<p>But given that this is a digit expansion, we want to be able to
express it as coefficients of powers of 10. That is to say, since we
regard 456 as 4*10^<sup>2</sup> + 5*10^<sup>1</sup> + 6*10^<sup>0</sup>
then how should we choose to represent 2.3 in order to continue the
pattern?</p>
<p>Answer: This is called the <b>decimal expansion</b> of a number,
in which we represent say 3/2 as 1.5 or as 1*10^<sup>0</sup> +
5*10^<sup>_1</sup>. That is to say, digit positions to the right of
the decimal mark those digits that are coefficients of a negative
power of 10. This coheres with what we've said elsewhere about
negative powers, which is that 1*10^<sup>0</sup> + 5*10^<sup>_1</sup>
= 1 + 5/10 = 3/2. In this way every decimal expansion that terminates
at some power of 10 has a representation as a ratio. Is the reverse
true?</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Convert 1.21 into a ratio. Also convert 1/3 into a
decimal expansion. 
</p>
<p>Answer: 1.21 = 121/100</p>
<p>Converting 1/3 is substantially harder. We want an equivalent
expression that will tell us what the coefficient of 1/10 should be
(obviously this number is smaller than 1 and so has no units digit).
Clearly 3 is the largest coefficient we can give it before the number
becomes too large, so that 1/3 is approximated by 3/10 but there is
still a bit left-over. The left-over bit is 1/3 - 3/10 = 1/30. We now
need to find an expression for this in decimal form and add it to our
current best approximation. The same problem as before arises, so we
approximate 1/30 by 3/100, which has the largest coefficient of 1/100
that we could pick before the number grows too large. 
</p>
<p>Of course this process repeats itself so that 1/3 ≈ 3/10 + 3/100
+ 3/1000 <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">=</font> 0.333 and we
can keep getting better approximations of 1/3 by choosing to expand
more digits. I write ≈ <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">to mean
&quot;approximately equal to&quot; which, for now, is a subjective
statement. </font>I don't want to write 1/3 = 0.333... just yet
because, although the equality is true, we can only claim this when
we have adequate justification for the &quot;...&quot; and that only
comes once we have studied Real Analysis. In any case, for now, take
the statement that 1/3 ≈ <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">0.333...
to mean that every extra digit of 0.333... gets you closer and closer
to 1/3.</font></p>
<p>Let's do it again for 1/7, but this time with a twist. Let's
assume that in some sense we already have the coefficients and
therefore we can write</p>
<p>$$\frac{1}{7} \approx \frac{a_1}{10} + \frac{a_2}{100} +
\frac{a_3}{100} + ...$$ 
</p>
<p>If we multiply both sides by 7 then we have 
</p>
<p>$$1 \approx \frac{7a_1}{10} + \frac{7a_2}{100} + \frac{7a_3}{1000}
+ ...$$</p>
<p>What this tells us that `a_1`, the coefficient for 1/10, must be
the largest multiple of 7 not to exceed 10. If `7a_1` were to exceed
10 we'd have a number bigger than 1 which would be a contradiction.
Then for `a_2` we have to pick the largest multiple not to exceed the
remainder from the previous choice--and so on. This hints at an
algorithm for computing the decimal expansion.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Give an algorithm to compute the decimal expansion of a
given ratio.</p>
<p>Answer: Of course the algorithm used before for integer division,
if continued with extra zeros after the integer part, will continue
to find the coefficients for descending powers of 10. 
</p>
<p>__Example__</p>
<p>This works because we keep finding the value that you can multiply
by so that we don't exceed the remainder, just as described above. Of
course I'm kind of equivocating on the meaning of &quot;remainder&quot;
here but it's fine.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Exercise: Find the ratio that is approximated by
.1234123412341234...</p>
<p>Answer: This won't be a thoroughly rigorously justified method
just yet, but it should make some sense. Call <i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">=
.123412341234... Then if we multiply by 10000 this will shift the
decimal four places so that 10000x = 1234.12341234... Then we can
cancel the decimals trailing off to infinity, so to speak, by finding
</span></span><i>10000x - x = 1234.12341234... - 0.12341234... =
1234</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
This was computing the decimal expansion difference but if we also
factor the left-hand-side we get </span></span><i>(10000-1)x</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">which
is </span></span><i>9999x</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.
This tells us that </span></span><i>9999x = 1243</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">and
so </span></span><i>x = 1234/9999.</i></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">This wasn't a
rigorous construction because it subtracted an infinity, so to speak,
of digits from another infinity of digits. We'll work on tightening
up the justification later but for now, just notice that if you
compute the decimal expansion of 1234/9999, you get .12341243... so
this method does seem to be getting it right even if we don't have a
rigorous proof of correctness.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Does every decimal expansion correspond to a rational
number?</p>
<p>Answer: We found an algorithm, so to speak, that finds a decimal
expansions that keeps getting close to sqrt(2) even though we know
that this number doesn't exist in the rationals. It was a
guess-and-check algorithm, but it keeps finding new rational numbers
that are better and better approximations of sqrt(2) without end. In
running this algorithm we find that it's 1.41421356... If we consider
the decimal sequence which has &quot;all&quot; of the decimals that
approximate sqrt(2), then this must not correspond to any rational
number. 
</p>
<p>Here's another decimal sequence that is not a rational number:
0.1011011101111011111...</p>
<hr/>

<p>Question: Can we prove that every digit expansion with a
non-repeating sequence of digits must not be rational? To say the
same thing in reverse: Can we prove that every rational number
produces a repeating digit expansion? Hint: if we use the division
algorithm on two integers, and the algorithm keeps running to
infinity, but the remainder at each step is always less than the
quotient, what could this tell us?</p>
<p>Answer: Since the remainder at every step is less than the
quotient, there are a finite number of possible values of the
remainder. However, if we assume we are generating an infinity of
digits by this process, then at some point the remainder must come up
again in the process. Once we arrive at a remainder that we've seen
before, the sequence of remainders after it and therefore the digit
sequence, will have to repeat over and over. 
</p>
<p>The upshot of these considerations are i) that we now have a proof
of the claim above that 0.10110111... is irrational, ii) that the
rational numbers are exactly the same numbers as those with repeating
digit sequences, and iii) therefore not every digit sequence
corresponds to a rational number. 
</p>

<p>Exercise: Let's bring up binary again. I like binary because not
only does it have use in CompSci and elsewhere, but particularly at
this stage of development, being able to implement an idea in binary
shows that you actually understand rather than fooling yourself when
you're really just coasting on the inertia of what you learned in
grade school. 
</p>
<p>So here are the exercises. Represent 1.5 and 1/3 in binary and
represent 0b0.011 in decimal. Also, as a point of interest, we know
that 1/3 ≈ <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">0.333... What is
1/3 if we were (for whatever reason) to use base-3?</font></p>
<p>Answer: 1.5 = 3/2 = 0b11 / 0b10 = 0b1.1</p>
<p>1/3 = 0b1 / 0b11. Since we expressed 1/3 in rational form, we may
leave the binary representation in rational form as well, and so call
it a day with this problem. If we want the binary digit form, we
would use the division algorithm and get 0b0.010101...</p>
<p>0b0.011 = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8</p>
<p>If we used base-3, something I've never actually heard of anyone
seriously using but still of brief interest, then I'll just use the
same digits that I do for decimal. There will be no confusion
introduced by this because nowhere else on this site will I mention
base-3 again. So to reiterate, using digits 0, 1, and 2 only, what is
one-third? The answer is 0.1. Interestingly this is a terminating
digit expansion so apparently whether a digit representation
terminates depends on the representation. Thus this feature of
numbers is not really a feature of numbers per se, but of numbers and
their representation.

<p>Exercise: Give a general characterization of what happens when you
divide a number, say <i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">,
by a positive number bigger than 1. Also characterize what happens
when you divide by 1. Also characterize what happens when you divide
by a positive number less than 1. Also characterize what happens when
you divide by a negative.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Answer:
Of course when dividing </span></span><i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">by
a positive number greater than 1, it shrinks toward 0. If </span></span><i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
positive that means it gets smaller, like going from 10 and then
after dividing by 2 becoming 5. If </span></span><i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">is
negative like _10, that means getting bigger by becoming _5. Of
course dividing by 1 doesn't change the number. By dividing by a
positive number less than 1, like 1/2, this makes </span></span><i>x</i><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">&quot;dilate&quot;
away from 0. For instance `\frac{10}{1//2} = \frac{10}{1}\ast
